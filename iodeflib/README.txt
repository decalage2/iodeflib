iodeflib
========

iodeflib is a python library to create, parse and edit cyber incident
reports using the IODEF XML format (`RFC
5070 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt>`_).

Project website: http://www.decalage.info/python/iodeflib

On the one hand, IODEF is a very rich, flexible and extensible XML
format to describe cyber incidents. On the other hand, it can be quite
complex to use in practice, because it is difficult to parse IODEF
content due to its rich features and deeply nested structure.

iodeflib is an attempt to provide a simple API to ease the development
of IODEF-aware scripts and applications.

iodeflib is different from the
`iodef <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iodef>`_ python package published on
PyPI and Sourceforge. In fact I created iodeflib because I was quite
disappointed by the complexity of the iodef package. iodef was generated
automatically from the IODEF XML schema using
`GenerateDS <http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html>`_, which
indeed exposes the complexity of the IODEF schema.

In contrast, iodeflib was carefully designed in order to keep the python
interface as simple as possible, hiding some unnecessarily nested
structures of the IODEF schema, and adding more convenient shortcuts.
Iodeflib is also designed to be extensible.

Usage
-----

The following sample scripts are provided in the iodeflib package, in
the examples subfolder.

How to parse IODEF data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        import iodeflib
        # open XML file and parse IODEF:
        iodef = iodeflib.parse_file('iodef.xml')
        # print some attributes for each incident:
        for incident in iodef.incidents:
            print 'Incident %s from %s - impact type: %s' % (incident.id,
                incident.id_name, incident.get_first_impact().type)
            for desc in incident.descriptions:
                print desc
            print 'Sources:'
            for system in incident.get_sources(): print system.get_addresses()
            print 'Targets:'
            for system in incident.get_targets(): print system.get_addresses()
            print ''

How to create IODEF data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        import iodeflib
        # create a new IODEF document:
        iodef = iodeflib.IODEF_Document()
        # create a new incident:
        incident1 = iodeflib.Incident(id='1234', id_name='CSIRT-X',
            report_time='2011-09-13T11:01:00+00:00',
            start_time='2011-09-13T10:19:24+00:00')
        # add description:
        incident1.descriptions = ['Detected denial of service attack']
        # add sources and targets:
        incident1.add_system(category='source', address='192.168.1.2')
        incident1.add_system(category='target', address='192.168.3.7', name='XYZ')
        # add impact assessment:
        incident1.add_impact(description='DoS on system XYZ', type='dos',
            severity='medium', completion='succeeded', occurence='actual',
            restriction='need-to-know')
        iodef.incidents.append(incident1)
        # serialize IODEF to XML, print it and save it to a file:
        print iodef
        open('iodef2.xml', 'w').write(str(iodef))

How to edit IODEF data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        # open XML file and parse IODEF:
        iodef = iodeflib.parse_file('iodef2.xml')
        # get incident, add end time and history item:
        incident1 = iodef.incidents[0]
        histitem = iodeflib.HistoryItem(descriptions=['Blocked source IP.'],
            datetime='2011-09-13T13:47:12+00:00')
        incident1.history.append(histitem)
        incident1.end_time='2011-09-13T13:47:12+00:00'
        incident1.report_time='2011-09-13T13:52:00+00:00'
        # save IODEF back to an XML file:
        print iodef
        open('iodef2_updated.xml', 'w').write(str(iodef))

Status
------

Not all the features of RFC 5070 are implemented yet. However, the most
useful classes are already available.
